# ts-calculator

This is just a little weekend project that I did for fun.

The plan was to implement a calculator with Typescript types.

Adding and multiplying strings works fine as long as the numbers don't get too big.

The parsing of a formula to an abstract syntax tree is also working as intended.

Sadly for the evaluation of the abstract syntax tree I hit some limits with Typescript.
